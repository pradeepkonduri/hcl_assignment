This consists of dynamic pages and MySQL database connectivity to them using JDBC connector.
The page consists of two buttons one of which debits the amount in the database by 1000 and the other credits thousand to the database and the current balance is dynamically displayed at the top.
Also the latest 5 transactions done are dynamically displayed which means if a transaction is done by clicking one of the buttons the corresponding transaction is displayed on the page dynamically.
Only one table is used to store all the trasactions and the table schema is shown. The table consists of an auto_incremental id column.
